*a)* A bar of mass [`m_b =[$mb]`] [`kg`] and length [`l = [$l]`] [`m`], is guided down a chute between four disks, each with mass of [`m_d = [$md]`] [`kg`] and radius [`r = [$r]`] [`mm`]. Assume that the forces on the disks are sufficient to prevent slipping, there is no friction at the pin joints, and the bar is released from rest. Find the velocity of the bar in each case after it has dropped a distance [`h = [$h]`] [`m`]. 

[`v_a=`] [_____] [`m/s`]  
[`v_b=`] [_____] [`m/s`]  
[`v_c=`] [_____] [`m/s`]  

*b)* Over time, the pin joints wear and develop friction that results in a moment about each pin - how would the value of velocity (after moving distance [`h`]) qualitatively compare to that of the frictionless pin in each case?

Case (a): [@ $mcLess->menu() @]*  
Case (b): [@ $mcEqual->menu() @]*  
Case (c): [@ $mcLess->menu() @]*
