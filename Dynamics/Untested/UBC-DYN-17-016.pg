	A rope is wrapped around a [`100`] [`kg`], [`2`] [`m`] diameter drum ([`A`]) and passes frictonless pulley [`B`]. Weight [`m=15`] [`kg`] is suspended from the rope. Caclulate the angular velocity of drum [`A`] [`[$t]`] seconds after weight [`m`] is released from rest. Assume the radius of gyration of drum [`A`] is [`1`] [`m`]. Neglect the mass of the rope and the friction between the rope and the pulley.
