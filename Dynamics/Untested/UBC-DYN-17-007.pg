	A basketball player [`2`] [`m`] tall jumps with a velocity of [`[$v]`] [`m/s`] at an angle [`[$theta]^{\circ}`] above the horizontal. At the peak of his jump, he throws the ball at a direction [`[$alpha]^{\circ}`] above the horizontal. Assume the ball is thrown at head level.
	1. How high did the basketball player jump?
	2. What must the speed of the ball (relative to the player) for it to be able to enter the rim? 
	3. Based on this speed, calculate the ball's absolute velocity has it passes through the rim.

	[`h=`] [______]{"$h"} [`m`]  
	[`v_{B/P}`] = [______]{"$vBP"} [`m/s`]  
	[`v_B=`] [______]{"$vBi"}[`i`] [`+`] [______]{"$vBj"}[`j`] [`m/s`]
