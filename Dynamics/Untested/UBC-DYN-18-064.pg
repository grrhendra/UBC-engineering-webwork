BEGIN_PGML


Assume that you are riding a one-wheel Segway on an inclined surface. Consider the case where the wheel is rotating with a constant speed of [`N = [$N]`] [`rpm`] but you are not moving forward and the wheel is slipping in place.  
1.	For how long is the wheel going to slip?
1.	Calculate the linear velocity of the center of the wheel [`[$dt]`] [`s`] after the wheel stops slipping.  

[@ image("UBC-DYN-18-064.png", width=>[$width], height=>[$height]) @]*

Use the following assumptions:
	[`\cdot`] Mass of the disk is [`m = [$m]`] [`kg`]  
	[`\cdot`] Radius of the disk is [`r = [$r]`] [`m`]  
	[`\cdot`] Radius of gyration of the disk about its center is [`r_G = [$rG]`] [`m`]  
	[`\cdot`] Angle of the inclined surface is [`\theta = [$theta]^{\circ}`]

[`v=`] [_____] [`m/s`]
