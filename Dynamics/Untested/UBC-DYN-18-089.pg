BEGIN_PGML

Two uniform thin rods each of mass [`m`] and length [`L`] are connected in a linkage. [`A`] is a fixed pin joint, [`B`] is a pin joint between the two rods, and [`D`] is a pin that slides freely in the frictionless vertical slot. Assume the system is released from rest at the instant shown (*state 1*).

[@ image("UBC-DYN-18-089.png", width=>[$width], height=>[$height]) @]*

*a)* Find an expression for the total energy  in the system at *state 1* (the position shown) in terms of [`m`], [`L`], and velocities. Include a sketch of the system, showing relevant velocities and datum(s).

[`E_1=`] [_____]{"$e1"} [`J`]  

*b)* Find an expression for the total energy in the system at a later time when [`A`] and [`D`] are at the same height (*state 2*) in terms of [`m`], [`L`], and velocities. Include a sketch of the system, showing relevant velocities and datum(s). (_HINT: suggest using ICZV._)

[`E_2=`] [_____]{"$e2"} [`J`]  

*c)* Find an expression for the velocity of [`D`] at *state 2* ([`A`] and [`D`] at the same height).

[`v_{D_2}=`] [_____]{"$v2"} [`m/s`]
