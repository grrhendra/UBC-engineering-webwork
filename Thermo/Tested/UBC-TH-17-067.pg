Refrigerator
$PAR 
Refrigerant-134a enters the evaporator coils placed at
the back of the freezer section of a household refrigerator at
120 kPa with a quality of 20 percent and leaves at 120 kPa
and -20Â°C. If the compressor consumes $W W of power and
the COP of the refrigerator is $COP, determine (a) refrigerator load and the mass flow
rate of the refrigerant, (b) enthalpy changed of the refrigerant and the rate of heat rejected to the
kitchen air.

Enthalpy changed of the refrigerant = \{ ans_rule(10)\} (kJ/kg) $PAR
