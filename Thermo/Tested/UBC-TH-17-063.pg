BEGIN_TEXT
Deceleration of Air in a Diffuser
$PAR 
Air at 10Â°C and $P_inlet kPa enters the diffuser of a jet engine steadily with a
velocity of $V_inlet m/s. The inlet area of the diffuser is $A_inlet m^2. The air leaves
the diffuser with a velocity that is very small compared with the inlet velocity.
Determine (a) Specific volume of the air at diffuser inlet, the mass flow rate of the air, (b) the enthalpy and temperature of
the air leaving the diffuser(Assumption: Cp = 1.005 and air is ideal gas).


$PAR

$PAR  
Inlet specific volume = \{ ans_rule(10)\} (m^3/kg) $PAR
Mass flow rate = \{ ans_rule(10)\} (kg/sec) $PAR
outlet enthalpy = \{ ans_rule(10)\} (kJ/kg) $PAR
outlet temperature = \{ ans_rule(10)\} (K) $PAR
