*Viscoelasticity*

A new type of composite elastomer is investigated for the sealing of a solid rocket booster. The viscoelastic behavior is crucial for the test. In particular, the activation energy for the viscous flow should be calculated for comparison with a theoretical model that predicts it to be [`[$lower_bound] \: \lt \: Q \: \lt \: [$upper_bound] \: KJ/mol`]. The experiments observe a relaxation time of [`[$time_1] \: s`] at [`[$temp_1] ^{\circ}C`] and [`[$time_2] \: s`] at [`[$temp_2] ^{\circ}C`]. Is the theoretical prediction accurate?

 BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

The relaxation time was derived as a function of viscosity and stiffness during one tutorial, giving [`t_0\: = \: \frac{3 \eta}{E}`] ; from the formula sheet, we have [`\eta \: = \: \frac{e^{\frac{Q}{RT}}}{3C}`] , hence [`t_0 \: = \: \frac{e^{\frac{Q}{RT}}}{CE}`] .

[`\frac{Q}{R} \: = `] [`\frac{log(\frac{[$time_1]}{[$time_2]})}{\frac{1}{[$temp_1_k]} - \frac{1}{[$temp_2_k]}} \: = `] [`[$Q_R]`]

From the formula sheet, [`R \: = `] [`8.314 \: J/mol\,k`], hence, [`Q\: = \:[$Q]`]
