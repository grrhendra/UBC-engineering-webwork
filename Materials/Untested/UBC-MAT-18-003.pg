BEGIN_PGML

A mild steel specimen exhibits a tensile strength of [`\sigma_f=[$sigmaf]`] [`MPa`].


*a)* Assuming all the strength comes from precipitates of carbon, what is the average spacing of them? (Steel has [`E=[$e]`] [`GPa`], [`\nu=[$nu]`] and [`b=[$b]`] [`nm`]) 

[`L=`] [_____]{"$l1"} [`nm`]  

*b)* After some heat treatment the strength is reduced of [`[$p1*100]%`], assuming again the strength only comes from precipitates, what is the new spacing? 

[`L=`] [_____]{"$l2"} [`nm`]  

*c)* Assume now all the strength from part *a* comes from carbon being solute inside iron (solid solute hardening), to increment the strength of [`[$p2*100]%`], how much would you need to change the atomic fraction of carbon? 

[_____]{"$p"} [`%`]  

*d)* If instead all the strength comes from ground boundary strengthening (Hall-Petch effect), what is the change in grain size that can increment the strength of [`[$p3*100]%`]?

[_____]{"$gs"} [`%`]
