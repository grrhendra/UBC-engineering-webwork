*Corrosion*  

Choose the best material to resist corrosion for a component subject to high temperature to renovate an old power station. Two alloys are the candidates to analyze as they passed previous tests based on mechanical properties, Alloy [`A`], and Alloy [`B`]. Both alloys form a protective oxide layer at the exposed surface, and the corrosion is then limited by the diffusion of oxygen ions. Corrosion tests done under [`[$exposure_time]`] hours of exposure and at [`[$temperature_t1]^{\circ} C `] show the following layer thicknesses: [`x_{A,1} \: = \: [$A_thickness_t1] \mu m\:`], [`x_{B,1} \: = \: [$B_thickness_t1] \mu m\:`]; while for the same exposure, [`x_{A,2} \: = \: [$A_thickness_t2] \mu m`], [`x_{B,2} \: = \: [$B_thickness_t2] \mu m`] are measured at [`[$temperature_t2]^{\circ} C`]. The operation conditions will be at [`[$operation_temperature]^{\circ} C`]. Which material is the best for this application and why? 

[`x_{A,3} \: = `] [_____]{$X_A_3} [`\mu m`]

[`x_{B,3} \: = `] [_____]{$X_B_3} [`\mu m`]

[@$stage1_mc->menu()@]*** is best for this application.

# part two of the question
BEGIN_PGML
What happens if the operation temperature lowers to [`[$temperature_t1]^{\circ} C `] for half of the operation time (remaining [`[$operation_temperature]^{\circ} C`] for the other half)? Motivate your answer.

[`x_{A,4} \: = `] [_____]{$X_A_4} [`\mu m`]

[`x_{B,4} \: = `] [_____]{$X_B_4} [`\mu m`]

[@$stage2_mc->menu()@]*** is best for this application.

[`x^2 \: = \: k \,t`] with [`k \: = \: k_0e^{-Q/RT}`], so for both materials we have [`(x_1/x_2)^2 \: = \: e^{-Q/R(1/T_1 \:- \:1/T_2)}`] , 

so, [`2log(x_1/x_2) \: =`] [`(1/T_2 \:- \: 1/T_1)Q/R  `], giving [`\frac{log(x_1/x_3)}{log(x_1/x_2)} \: = `] [`(1/T_3 \:- \:1/T_1)(1/T_2 \:- \:1/T_1)`]

and, [`(x_3/x_1) \: = \: exp[log(x_2âx_1 )(1/T_3 -1/T_1 ))â((1/T_2 -1/T_1 ) )`]


If T=[`[$temperature_t1]^{\circ} C `] for half the time, we can make a simple model considering a first stage of 10 h (half of the 20 h) having [`[$operation_temperature]^{\circ} C `] and a second stage with [`[$temperature_t1]^{\circ} C `] for the remaining 10 h. As you remember from the derivation of the parabolic law, we have [`x^2\: = \: k\,t`] under the condition of [`x_{t=0} = 0`]. In this case this hypothesis works only for the first stage. Let us do all the reasoning for material [`A`] and then extend this to material [`B`]. We have then [`x_{A,4-1}^2\: = \: k_{A,3}\frac{t}{2}`], where [`k_{A,3}`] is the coefficient associated with [`[$operation_temperature]^{\circ} C `], and t is the 20 h time. We can then write [`x_{A,4-1}^2\; =\: frac{x_{A,3}^2}{2}`], since [`x_{A,3}^2\:=\:k_{A,3}t`] . For the second stage we can restart our clock from 0 but we wonât have [`x_{t=0}\:=\:0 `]anymore, we will have instead [`x_{t=0}=x_{A,4-1}`]. At this point we have [`x_{A,4}^2\:=\:x_{A,4-1}^2\:+\:k_{A,1}t/2`], with [`k_{A,1}`] the coefficient associated with [`[$temperature_t1]^{\circ} C `]. From the previous formula, [`x_{A,4}^2\:=\:(k_1+k_3 )t/2`] which can also be rewritten as [`x_{A,4}^2\:=\:((x_{A,1}^2\:+\:x_{A,3}^2 ))/2`]. Finally [`x_{A,4}\:=\:(((x_{A,3}^2\:+\:x_{A,1}^2 ))/2)^{1/2}\:=`] [`[$X_A_4] \mu m`], and [`x_{B,4}\:=\:(((x_{B,3}^2\:+\:x_{B,1}^2 ))/2)^{1/2}\:=`] [`[$X_B_4] \mu m`]. In both cases [`A`] is the best as it shows the smallest oxide layer thickness after 20 hours of operation, meaning the oxidation is slowest in A
