*Eco-Materials* 

You need to design handrails for a net-zero energy building and as such, it is essential to minimize the energy required to make the handrails. The hand rail must not deflect more than a defined amount to perform its function as a railing (minimum required stiffness). Define a material index for the hand rail (you can approximate it as a square beam) and use the charts in chapter 15 to select a material. What are the top two material families? Enter r for [`\rho`] and H for [`H`].

[`M \: = `] [______]{$M}

 BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

You wish to minimize energy so your objective function is mass [`X`] embodied energy. The mass of a square beam is: [`m\: = \:AL\rho \: = \: b^2 L \rho`] thus the energy required for the materials is: energy = [`H_m b^2 l \rho`] the bending stiffness must be at least [`S^*:`] [`S \: = \: \frac{C_2 EI}{L^3} \: \geq \: S^* `] where [`C_2`] is a constant. [`I`] of a square beam is: [`I \: = \: \frac{b^4}{12}`].  Assuming [`L`] and [`S^*`] are fixed eliminate [`b`] and obtain the objective function: energy = [`(\frac{12 S^* L^3}{C_2})^{1/2}(L)(\frac{\rho H_m}{E^(1/2)} `]. We want to minimize energy so we take the inverse and get a material index of [`M\: =\: \frac{E^{1/2}}{\rho H_m }`]. From Figure 15.9 Non-technical ceramics are the best option followed by some natural materials (Bamboo, wood parallel to grain) and some technical ceramics (soda glass).
