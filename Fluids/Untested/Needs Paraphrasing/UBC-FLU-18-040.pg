Illustrated in the diagram is a device which is used to measure the viscosity of water. The device is comprised of a tank and a capillary tube. The flow is laminar and has negligible entrance loss, with friction head loss characterized by [`h_f=\frac{32\mu LV}{\rho gd^2}`]. Temperature is measured with a thermometer to be [`T = 16.5^{\circ}C`], and flowrate measured using a stopwatch and graduated cylinder to be [`Q = [$Q]`] [`mL/s`]. Density is measured by weighing a known volume to be [`\rho = 998.7`] [`kg/m^3`]. What is [`\mu`] given the following dimensional information, [`d = [$D]`] [`in`], [`L = 36.1`] [`in`], and [`H = 0.153`] [`m`]?

[`\mu=`] [____]{"$Ans"} [`kg/m\cdot s`]
