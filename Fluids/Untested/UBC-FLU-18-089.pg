BEGIN_PGML

As part of a manufacturing process, a cylindrical component of diameter [`[$InnerDia]`] [`m`] and length [`[$Length]`] [`m`] is passed through a cylindrical fluid domain of diameter [`[$OuterDia]`] [`m`]. The component is being pulled through the fluid domain at a speed of [`[$InnerVel]`] [`m/s`], while the fluid within the domain between the two cylinders is being driven in the opposite direction with a pressure gradient of [`[$PressureGrad]`] [`Pa/m`]. If the fluid is glycerin at [`20^{\circ}C`], determine the force per unit length needed to maintain the velocity of the component. Assume that the flow is laminar, fully developed, and steady. Since the length of the cylindrical component is significantly larger than its diameter, assume that the drag force on the object is solely generated by skin friction.
