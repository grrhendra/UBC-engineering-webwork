BEGIN_PGML

Steady, fully-developed, laminar, two-dimensional flow exists between three infinitely large flat plates. The top and bottom plates are fixed, while the middle plate is free to move in the [`x`] direction. Flow in the top domain is driven by a linear pressure _drop_ of [`[$PressureDrop]`] [`Pa/m`] (note the emphasis on the word _drop_). The lower domain is not subject to a pressure drop. If the fluid in both regions is glycerin at [`20^{\circ}C`], and the heights of the top and bottom domains are [`H_1 = [$Height1]`] [`m`] and [`H_2 = [$Height2]`] [`m`], determine the steady-state speed (magnitude only) of the middle plate. Assume that the middle plate is a rigid barrier with no thickness.
