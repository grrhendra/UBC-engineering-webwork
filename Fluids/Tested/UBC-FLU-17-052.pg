BEGIN_PGML
Consider a rectangular foam boat [`10`] [`cm`] wide by [`20`] [`cm`] long by [`4`] [`cm`] deep. Imagine this boat is loaded with enough cargo so the bottom sits [`2`] [`cm`] below the waterline. Estimate the maximum speed (i.e. steady state speed) of the boat in [`m/s`] if the driving mass is [`78`] [`g`]. Assume that the towline length is not a factor.

This is a difficult quantity to solve for exactly with analytical methods. You may wish to use Excel or MATLAB to solve numerically, or plot the relevant functions to determine this graphically.
