BEGIN_PGML
The combustion in a gasoline engine may be approximated by a constant volume heat addition process, and the contents of the combustion chamber both before and after combustion as air.  The conditions are [`[$a]`] [`MPa`] and [`[$b]^{\circ}C`] before combustion,and [`[$c]^{\circ} C`] after it. Determine the pressure in MPa at the end of the combustion process.

[`P =`] [__________]{$h} [`MPa`]
