BEGIN_PGML

Water is to be withdrawn from an [`[$A]`] [::m::] high water reservoir by drilling a [`[$B]`] [::cm::] diameter hole at the bottom surface. Disregarding the effect of the kinetic energy correction factor, determine the flow rate of water through the hole if the entrance of the hole is well-rounded.

[`\dot{V}=`] [_____]{$ans} [`m^3/s`]
