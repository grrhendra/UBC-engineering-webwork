BEGIN_PGML
Consider a rectangular foam boat [`17.4`] [`cm `] wide by [`20.7`] [`cm`] long by [`4.0`] [`cm`] deep. Imagine this boat is loaded with enough cargo so the bottom sits [`1.7`] [`cm`] below the waterline. Determine the pressure drag force, in [`N`], if the boat moves at [`0.85`] [`m/s`] and the pressure drag coefficient is taken to be [`33`].
