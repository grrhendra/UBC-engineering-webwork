BEGIN_PGML

Two horizontal jets are pointed at two different surfaces.  Surface [`1`] deflects the jet [`90^{\circ}`] such that the jet exits in the downwards direction.  Surface [`1`] is supported by a horizontal force F1 directed towards the incoming jet. Surface [`2`] deflects the jet [`180^{\circ}`] such that the jet exits in in a horizontal direction directed back towards the incoming jet.   Surface [`2`] is supported by a horizontal force, [`F_2`], directed towards the incoming jet.



How are [`F_1`] and [`F_2`] related?



The mass flow rates and velocities of the two jets are the same, and the cross sectional areas of the jets do not change noticeably.
