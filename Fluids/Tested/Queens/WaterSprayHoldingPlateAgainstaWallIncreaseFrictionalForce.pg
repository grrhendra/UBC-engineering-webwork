BEGIN_PGML

A stream of water exits a nozzle of diameter [`D`], and it pins a metal plate again a wall. The plate has a mass of [`m`], and the coefficient of friction between the plate and the wall is [`\mu`]. Recall from introductory physics that a force of [`F = mg/\mu`] is required to keep the plate from sliding down the wall. Water exits the nozzle with an average velocity of [`V_{1}`], which is exactly the velocity required to hold the plate in place.
