BEGIN_PGML

The pressure drop per unit length of a smooth-walled pipe, through which water at [`15.6^{\circ}C`] is flowing, is to be determined with a [`1:3`] scale model. The velocity of the water is [`[$Vw]`] [`m/s`]. The model fluid is ethyl alcohol at [`20^{\circ}C`]. What is the required velocity of ethyl alcohol to maintain dynamic similarity? ([`\rho_{H_2O} = 999`] [`Kg/m^3`], [`\mu_{H_2O}= 1.12\cdot 10^{-3}`] [`N\cdot s/m^2`]; [`\rho_{alcohol} = 789`] [`Kg/m^3`], [`\mu_{alchohol}= 1.19\cdot 10^{-3}`] [`N\cdot s/m^2`])

Discussion: Why would you use alcohol in your test system instead of water? Are there good reasons for doing the opposite: testing with water in your lab when the prototype will be a flow of alcohol in a chemical plant?

[`V_{alcohol}=`][____] [`m/s`]
