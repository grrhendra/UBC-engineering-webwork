BEGIN_PGML

Bill works for a car company that has recently designed a new prototype of a four door family sedan car. However, before constructing the prototype Bill would like to get an idea of the drag force that the car will have at typical operating conditions. The car's expected average driving speed is [`V = [$V]`] [`km/h`] through air at standard conditions. 

Suppose that Bill would like to model the drag force with a [`1/10`] scale model submerged in water. How fast must the model be moved through the water ([`\mu`] = [`1.12*10^{-3 }`] [`Ns/m^{2}`]) to emulate the driving conditions of the prototype?

[`V_{model}=`][____] [`km/h`]
