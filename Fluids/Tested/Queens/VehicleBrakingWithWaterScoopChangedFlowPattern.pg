BEGIN_PGML

A vehicle of mass m is moving with a velocity of [`V_{0}`] uses a scoop as a braking system by lowering it into a river. The river flows with a velocity of [`V_{r}`] (opposite direction of the vehicle's velocity). The scoop has a width of [`w = 0.2`] [`m`], and it redirects flow from the river by [`180^{\circ}`]. The scoop has been designed such that water will flow onto it with the same height, [`h`], as the water redirected away from it. The figure below depicts the designed performance of the braking system

[@ image('VehicleBrakingWithWaterScoopChangedFlowPattern.png', width=>644, height=>327) @]*

Suppose that the system's actual performance is not exactly as designed. Turbulence resulting from the geometry and surface roughness of the scoop causes the water to actually have a height of [`1.1`] [`h`] when it is redirected away from the scoop. Water flow entering the scoop still has a height of [`h`]. How does this affect the braking force applied to the vehicle?
