Your facility already includes multiple TACO TA 0824 pumps, so using the same pump for a new application has many advantages in terms of spares and maintenance costs. The new application has a design flow of [`0.05`] [`m^3/s`] and a head of [`65`] [`m`] pumping water at [`20^{\circ}C`]. The application includes [`42`] [`m`] of useful elevation gain with the rest being losses, so the system curve can be expressed as [`H = 42 + 23\cdot(\frac{Q}{50})^2`] for [`H`] in metres and [`Q`] in litres/s

The TA 0824 running at 3500 RPM appears to be in the right range. (Look towards the end of the curve book.)

We ordered one with a [`8.5`] [`inch`] impeller and a moderate efficiency electric motor ([`85%`]). At [`10`] cents a kilowatt hour for electricity, what will the annual electric cost be if we are operating at design flow? ([`24 \times 365 = 8760`] operating hours per year, pick the closest answer)

Discussion: Would it make sense to change your motor selection for one that is more or less efficient? Explain.

Compare your value to what it would take to drive a car on the highway continuously for a year. Does it make sense?
