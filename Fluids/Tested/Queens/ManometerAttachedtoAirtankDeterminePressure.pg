BEGIN_PGML

A Water manometer is attached to a small pressurized air tank with the geometry depicted below. The heights of the depicted points of the system are: [`h_{1}= [$h1]`] [`m`], [`h_{2}= [$h2]`] [`m`], and [`h_{3} = [$h3]`] [`m`].

[@ image('ManometerAttachedtoAirtankDeterminePressure.png', width=>400, height=>449) @]*

Based on this geometry, determine the pressure in the air tank [`P_{2}`].

Discussion: How high would the pressure in the tank have to be before the density of the air became important to your answer? Could you build a this system to work on that pressure scale?

[`P_{gauge}=`][____] [`kPa`]

_Hint:The ideal gas law is your friend..._
