The piping system is as shown, consisting of [`[$L]`] metres of [`4`] inch schedule 40 commercial steel pipe with long radius, flanged elbows and a globe valve. The elevation difference between the Lake on the Mountain and the pipe exit is [`[$H]`] metres. What will the flow rate be with the valve fully open?
