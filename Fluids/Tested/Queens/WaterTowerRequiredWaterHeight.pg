BEGIN_PGML

Many small towns supply their citizens with water from a water tower. The height of the tower is used to provide sufficient head for many households and small businesses. For this particular tower a water main pipe of [`2''`] SCH 40, commercial steel piping is used. The entry to the pipe in the tower has a well-rounded configuration, and a regular, [`90^{\circ}`] flanged bend is placed at the bottom of the tower. The water must travel through [`[$L]`] [`m`] of water main pipeline before branching into smaller supply pipes, and during typical daily operation the flow rate in the water main will be [`[$Q]`] [`m^{3}/s`]. In order to provide adequate supply flow to the branch lines, [`[$ph]`] [`m`] of pressure head are required at the end of the water main line.

What is the minimum required height of water in the tower, [`h`]?

[`h=`][____] [`m`]

_Hint:Friction factor should be around 0.0125._
