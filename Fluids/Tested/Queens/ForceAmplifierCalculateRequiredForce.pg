BEGIN_PGML

A hydraulic force amplification device is used to lift a mass of [`m = [$m]`] [`kg`] that sits on a piston with an area of [`A_{2} = [$A2]`] [`m^{2}`]. The mass is supported by applying a force, [`F`], at a piston with an area [`A_{1} = [$A1]`] [`m^2`]. 

[@ image('ForceAmplifierCalculateRequiredForce.png', width=>579, height=>316) @]*

What is the force [`F`], required to support the mass if the heights of each piston are [`h_{1} = [$h1]`] [`m`] and [`h_{2}= [$h2]`] [`m`], as indicated on the diagram?

[`F=`][____] [`N`]
