This swing gate is used to hold back water in a channel. The channel is [`1`] [`m`] wide, and the water is [`h = [$h]`] metres deep. The swing gate sits at an angle of [`\theta = [$th]^{\circ}`], as depicted.

[@ image('SwingGateMoment.png', width=>854, height=>263) @]*

The gate could be supported entirely by a force and moment on the pin at the bottom, or by other reaction forces at mountings not shown in this diagram. Neglecting the weight of the gate, determine the total moment about the pin at the bottom that must be sustained by the gate.

Discussion: Develop equations for both horizontal and vertical forces on the gate, as well as the moment about the pin on the bottom, each as functions of both [`\theta`] and [`h`]. Start from integrals of pressure over the surfaces, not point forces.

Where would you locate an additional support to carry these loads?
