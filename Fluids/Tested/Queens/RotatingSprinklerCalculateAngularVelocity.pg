A rotating sprinkler is used to water the grass on a lawn. Water flows into the sprinkler with a velocity of [`V_{1} = [$V1]`] [`m/s`] through a circular inlet of diameter [`D = [$D]`] [`cm`]. Water then flows out through four arms of length [`R = [$R]`] [`m`] and is sprayed at a [`90^{\circ}`] angle through circular holes of diameter [`d = 0.5`] [`cm`]. The sprinkler operates at steady-state, and friction in the system was assumed to be negligible.

What is the angular velocity, [`\omega`], of the rotating sprinkler system?

Discussion: What changes could you make to the system to increase the angular velocity?

[`\omega=`][____] [`rad/s`]
