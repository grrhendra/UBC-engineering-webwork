BEGIN_PGML

A hot water heating system pumps water through a fired heater (furnace) then to a convector to transfer the heat to the room air. (In a real system there would be many convectors in parallel / series, but we have simplified the system to make the details easier to manage.)

The piping is [`2`] [`inch`] schedule 40 commercial steel (roughness [`0.05`] [`mm`]) with a total length of [`100`] [`m`] The furnace and the convector can be represented by minor loss coefficients of [`10`] and [`15`] respectively and there are other fittings and valves with a total [`K`] of [`3.5`]. The height of the convector above the pump is [`10`] [`m`].

The system is designed for a flow rate of [`5`] litres per second, however it may operate at lower flow rates.

What pump head rise in metres is required to drive a flow of [`[$Q]`] litres per second through the piping system? (Assume [`20^{\circ}C`] for water properties for simplicity.)
