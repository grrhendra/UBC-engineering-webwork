BEGIN_PGML
Consider a rectangular foam boat [`18.0`] [`cm`] wide by [`22.5`] [`cm`] long by [`4.2`] [`cm`] deep. Imagine this boat is loaded with enough cargo so the bottom sits [`1.6`] [`cm`] below the waterline. Determine the expected wave drag force, in [`N`], if the boat moves at [`0.37`] [`m/s`] (assuming the relationship in the lab manual for wave drag holds true).
