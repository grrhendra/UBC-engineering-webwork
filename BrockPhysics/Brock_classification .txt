Some mistakes in formatting detected in the problems from Fluid statics

Formatting mistakes in Physics of Hearing

Foramtting mistkaes in Electric field, coulombs law

Electric current    - current
                    - Ohms law resistance...
                    - Resistance and resistivity

Magnetism : - Magnetic field strength on a moving charge
            - Force on a moving charge
            - The Hall effect
            - Magnetic force on a current carrying wire
            - Torque on a current loop 
            - Magnetic force between two parallel conductors

Something weird about the Geometric Opctics - law of reflection 
Something weird about fusion in medical applications of nuclear physics

Particle Physics: - yukawa particles
                  - Accelerators
                  - Quarks (only small formatting error in NU_U17-33-05-001.pg)
                  - Guts
                  - Missing questions from Cosmology
                  - No questions in super strings


most of these problems seem to have issues with either formatting or the such, The best thing to do is to either manually fix the ones which instructors are interested in,
or wait till they are all fixed by the original uploaders on Git and update the folders from the APSC TLEF folder with corrected files then.
