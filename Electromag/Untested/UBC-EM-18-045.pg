A conducting wire with finite length is bent into a shape as shown in the figure and has mass of [`[$m]`] [`g`]. The upper horizontal part of the wire has length of [`[$l]`] [`cm`] and is placed in a uniform magnetic field with [`B = [$B]`] [`T`] pointing into the page. The two lower ends of the wires are respectively inserted into two shallow mercury tanks, and the mercury in the two slots is connected to a power source with a switch. When the switch is turned on, the wire will jump out and disconnect with the mercury. If the jump height is [`[$h]`] [`cm`], find the amount of charge [`Q`] that passes through the wire.
