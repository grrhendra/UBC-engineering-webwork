As shown in the figure, two semi-infinite long filamentary conducting wires carrying current [`I = [$I]`] [`A`] are connected to a circular conducting rung with resistance [`R = [$R]`] [`\Omega`] at points [`A`] and [`B`], respectively. The extension lines of the two conducting wires passes through the center of the ring and form an angle [`\theta=[$theta]^{\circ}`]. The ring has a radius [`a = [$a]`] [`m`] and is made of homogeneous material. The current is split at point [`A`] and recombined at point [`B`]. Find [`H`] at the center of the ring.
