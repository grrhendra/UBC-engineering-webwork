As shown in Fig.([`a`]), a spherical capacitor is made of two concentric, thin shells with its inner shell radius [`R_1 = [$R1]`] [`m`] and its outer shell radius [`R_4 = [$R4]`] [`m`]. The inner shell [`R_1`] has a uniformly distributed charge [`Q = [$Q]`] [`\mu C`]. Assume that the space between the inner and outer shells has [`\epsilon = \epsilon_0`]. Answer the following questions:

*a)* Find the capacitiance between [`R_1`] and [`R_4`].

	[`C=`] [_____] [`pF`]  

*b)* As shown in Fig.([`b`]), another concentric spherical thin shell is placed between [`R_1`] and [`R_4`] with its shell radius [`R_2 = [$R2]`] [`m`]. Comparing with *a*, will the total capacitance become greater, equal, or less? [@ $mcEqual->menu() @]*

*c)* What is the total capacitance of the capacitor in *b*?

	[`C=`] [_____] [`pF`]  

*d)* As shown in Fig.([`c`]), instead of using a thin shell, a thick conducting shell is placed between [`R_1`] and [`R_4`] with its inner radius [`R_2 = [$R2]`] [`m`] and outer radius [`R_3 = [$R3]`] [`m`]. Comparing with *a*, will the total capacitance become greater, equal, or less? [@ $mcGreater->menu() @]*

*e)* What is the total capacitance of the capacitor in *d*?

	[`C=`] [_____] [`pF`]
