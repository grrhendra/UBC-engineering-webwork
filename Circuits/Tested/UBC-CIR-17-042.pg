BEGIN_TEXT

If the voltage supply gives a square wave output from \(+$V\) \(V\) to \(-$V\) \(V\), what is the maximum output frequency such that the inductor current, \(i_L\), has enough time to reach \($X%\) of the target steady state current? Assume \(R = $R\) \(k\Omega\), \(L = $L\) \(H\), and the frequency is measured in Hz based on the full square wave.
